A Logistic Management System is a software solution that helps businesses manage and streamline the entire logistics process, including transportation, inventory management, order fulfillment, and more. When built using Java and MySQL, the system provides a robust backend to handle business logic and data storage, while also ensuring scalability and reliability. Here's an overview of the system:

Key Features:
Order Management:

Allows the tracking of orders from customers.
Each order can be linked to a customer and includes details like delivery date, status, and shipment tracking.
Shipment Tracking:

Tracks the status of goods being shipped from the warehouse to customers.
Includes features for marking shipments as "dispatched," "in transit," and "delivered."
Customer Management:

Stores customer details such as name, address, contact information, and order history.
Helps in tracking which customer made which order, along with their shipping details.
Driver and Vehicle Management:

Manages details about drivers (e.g., name, contact, assigned vehicles) and vehicles (e.g., type, capacity, registration).
Assigns drivers to specific shipments based on location, availability, and vehicle capacity.
Inventory Management:

Manages the stock of goods and products in the warehouse.
Tracks the quantities, prices, and shipping statuses of items in the inventory.
Reports:

Generates reports for operations, such as total shipments made, order statuses, customer information, and financial summaries.
System Architecture:
Frontend: User Interface (UI) which can be built using JavaFX, Swing, or web-based frameworks.
Backend: Java handles the business logic (order processing, shipment tracking, etc.), making queries and operations to interact with the database.
Database: MySQL serves as the relational database to store data about customers, orders, shipments, drivers, and vehicles.
Database Structure (MySQL):
The database is designed to handle key entities:

Customers: Stores customer information.
Orders: Tracks orders placed by customers.
Shipments: Manages the shipment of goods tied to orders.
Drivers: Manages driver information.
Vehicles: Stores vehicle details used for shipments.
Backend Logic (Java):
Java will be used to:

Connect to MySQL using JDBC.
Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for entities like orders, shipments, and customers.
Handle logic for assigning drivers, updating shipment status, and notifying customers.
Technologies Involved:
Java: Backend development using Java for business logic, database operations, and the user interface.
MySQL: Database management to store and manage large amounts of logistic data.
JDBC: Java Database Connectivity to interact with MySQL from Java code.
Use Cases:
Customer Orders: A customer places an order, which is then processed, stored, and linked to a shipment.
Shipment Progress: As the shipment is in transit, the system updates its status (e.g., dispatched, in transit, delivered).
Driver and Vehicle Assignment: The system assigns drivers to shipments based on vehicle availability and location.
This system helps companies manage their logistics operations in an organized manner, reduces errors in shipment processing, and improves customer satisfaction by providing tracking capabilities and accurate delivery status.
